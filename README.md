# Health-Expenditure-and-Coverage-Analysis

# Introduction

National health expenditure is the official estimate of health care expenses in the United States.  We have three categories of insursnce data. 
1.	Medicare 
2.	Medicaid 
3.	Private Health Insurance
Medicare is a federal program that provides health coverage if you are 65+ or under 65 and have a disability, no matter your income. 
Medicaid is a state and federal program that provides health coverage if you have a very low income. Private health insurance refers to any health insurance coverage that is not offered by a state or federal government.
Health expenditure data files (1991-2014) present the aggregate estimates for health care consumption, including the establishment of delivering care (hospitals, physicians and clinics, nursing homes, etc.) and medical products (prescription drugs, over-the-counter medicines) purchased in retail outlets.
Hospital Information comprises all the hospital related details like unique Id, Hospital Type, Hospital Ownership and ratings in various states.
Physician Information consists of all the physicians related details like unique ID, Physician Field, Specialty and location in various states.

# OBJECTIVES

A data warehouse is built by populating enrollment and expenditure data of healthcare by state and region, US population data, hospitals registered, and physician profiles associated with the same. 
The data in our data warehouse will help us to perform different analyses on how the U.S. healthcare expenditure has changed over time. It will allow us to draw insights on the percentage of state spending as a share of the national total and various other population and location-specific analysis.
We want to analyze how healthcare service is developed in each state and to answer questions related to the underlying relationships between expenditure, enrollment.
